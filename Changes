        - No functional changes.

        - [Bugfix] scripts/ or bin/ files need to have something like #!perl and
          not #!/usr/bin/env perl so it can be replaced to the path of perl when
          installing [RT#96884]


0.01    2014-06-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release. Separated from XPAN-Query distribution to make
